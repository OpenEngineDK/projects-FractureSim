\chapter*{Summary}
% What?
This thesis is within the field of simulated surgery and motivated by
the current demand for an educational tool 
teaching the common procedure of wisdom tooth extraction.
Attention is focused on how to simulate the fragmentation 
that will separate the crown of the tooth from its roots.
%
% How
We present a general method for crack prediction and propagation in
volumetric solids based upon
real-time structural analysis. The analysis is conducted using the
finite element method and the Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics
solving technique with a parallel approach.
%
The stress and strain analysis is based on 
the theoretical laws of physics and the crack prediction is based on
the theory of maximum principal stress from fracture
mechanics.
%
% So?
%
The failure surface as predicted by the
crack tracking algorithm looks very promising. The location and
curvature of the failure surface corresponds to the stress analysis
and the intuition of how an object would actually fracture.
%
Benchmarking the simulation model reveals great potential towards
real-time interaction and visual feedback.
